# Description
The project aims to analyze the Iris dataset from the scikit-learn library and compare the performance of different machine learning models using various evaluation metrics.

# Dependencies
If running wtih VSCode, make sure to follow the steps to setup the environnement with this tutotial  
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial#_set-up-a-data-science-environment
If running with Jupyter Notebook or Colab, no need to install anything !

# The data set
The data set is imported from the scikit-learn library, no need to read it with pandas !
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers,
categorized into three species:  
-->Setosa  
-->Versicolor  
-->Virginica   
Each flower is described by four features (measured in centimeters):  
-->Sepal Length  
-->Sepal Width  
-->Petal Length  
-->Petal Width
